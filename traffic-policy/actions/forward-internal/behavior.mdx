## Behavior

### Managing Fallback Behavior (`on_error`)

If `on_error` is set to `halt` (default) and the action encounters an error when forwarding traffic the Traffic Policy chain will halt and no further actions will be executed. For example, if you have a `log` action after the `forward-internal` action and the `url` specified isn't an online endpoint, the `log` action will not be run and the error will be returned.

However, if `on_error` is set to `continue`, actions that appear after the `forward-internal` action will still be executed even if the `forward-internal` action encounters an error. This can be used as a fallback to forward traffic to one of many endpoints depending which are online.
